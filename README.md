A work in progress. A way to mirror and keep that mirror up to date of all the public add-ons on addons.mozilla.org.

*Warning:* under construction

Usage:

    cd src
    python fetch.py
    python download.py

Will fetch all the responses for a bunch of add-ons. Download will then grab all the files for those add-ons.
